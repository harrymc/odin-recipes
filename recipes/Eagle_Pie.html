<p>
    Eagle pie is a savory dish that typically
    consists of a filling made of eagle meat and 
    vegetables, such as carrots, peas, and onions,
    cooked in a creamy sauce, and baked in a pie crust
    until golden brown. The pie crust can be either a
    traditional shortcrust pastry or a puff pastry,
    and is usually made with butter or lard to achieve
    a flaky, tender texture.
